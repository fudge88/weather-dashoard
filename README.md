## Summary

This weather app is dynamically created using JQuery, and also runs on Live time. The purpose of this app is to inform the user of the current weather details, and to display the forecast for the following 5 days. This app is made accessible by colour coding the UVI, showing different colours for different levels of alerts. The use of icons and a simple sectioned layout also helps break down the information. The app is fully responsive and collapses the widespread information from a widescreen to a mobile friendly manner.

#### APIs:

When you use an application on your mobile phone, the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server. The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions and sends it back to your phone. The application then interprets that data and presents you with the information you wanted in a readable way. This is what an API is - all of this happens via API. In this example the API takes the weather APIs response to your request and delivers it right back to the weather dashboard, which then shows you the most updated, relevant information.
