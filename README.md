## Summary

This weather app is dynamically created using JQuery, and also runs on Live time. The purpose of this app is to inform the user of the current weather details, and to display the forecast for the following 5 days. This app is made accessible by colour coding the UVI, showing different colours for different levels of alerts. The use of icons and a simple sectioned layout also helps break down the information. The app is fully responsive and collapses the widespread information from a widescreen to a mobile friendly manner.

#### JQuery:

JQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, handle events, and develop applications. JQuery has a large library built upon JavaScript. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications. For example rather the creating element by element, assigning attributes to each, as you would with JavaScript. JQuery allows direct HTML code to be pasted into the `script` file using 'back-ticks'. JQuery also allows 'template-string' that dynamically changes each iteration of a repeated code using a simple 'string'.
